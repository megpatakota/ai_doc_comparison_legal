# Summary of Changes

The two documents under comparison — referred to herein as **Document V1** (older iTunes-related Terms) and **Document V2** (more recent Apple Media Services Terms) — set out contract terms for digital media services and related offerings from Apple. While both documents cover the provision of digital content, consumer rights, licensing, and liabilities, **Document V2** broadens its scope significantly. It reflects Apple’s evolution from offering “iTunes Store, Mac App Store, App Store and iBooks Store” to providing a suite of modern service offerings (e.g., Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Podcasts Subscriptions, Apple Fitness+, Apple Arcade, and Apple One).

Below is an overview of notable differences, affected parties, legal implications, and other observations.

### Overview of Differences

- **Expanded Service Coverage**:  
  - Document V1 focuses heavily on the iTunes Store, Mac App Store, App Store, and iBooks Store.  
  - Document V2 encompasses Apple’s broader ecosystem, including Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, Apple Fitness+, Apple One, Apple Music, Apple Podcasts, etc.

- **Contracting Parties & Regional Variations**:  
  - Document V1 references “iTunes S.à r.l.,” whereas Document V2 references multiple Apple entities (Apple Inc., Apple Canada Inc., Apple Distribution International Ltd., etc.) based on the user’s “Home Country.” This can alter the applicable law and dispute resolution forum.
  
- **Subscription and Payment Terms**:  
  - Document V1 sets out general payment/refund terms mainly for purchases.  
  - Document V2 addresses recurring billing through subscriptions (e.g., Apple Music, Apple TV Channels, Apple One, Arcade). It also elaborates on the management of multiple payment methods, Apple Pay usage, and subscription renewal mechanics.

- **Returns, Refunds, and Cancellations**:  
  - Document V1 includes a 14-day right of cancellation with exceptions once digital content has been accessed.  
  - Document V2 similarly provides a 14-day right of cancellation but clarifies how it applies to subscription trials, in-app purchases, and streaming. It adds more instructions on how to cancel subscriptions and renewals.

- **Rights and Licensing**:  
  - Document V1 licenses digital content (music, apps, iBooks) subject to iTunes-specific usage rules.  
  - Document V2 updates usage rules across a larger array of Apple services, including new constraints on streaming, “Family Sharing,” and “In-App Purchases,” reflecting Apple’s shift to subscription offerings and bundling.

- **Dispute Resolution & Governing Law**:  
  - Document V1 is governed primarily by English law for many international transactions.  
  - Document V2 adopts Californian law for U.S. residents but simultaneously acknowledges local law for EU or other territory-specific consumers. The approach to dispute resolution is more nuanced.

### Affected Parties

1. **Consumers**:  
   - Individuals now have expanded rights and obligations under a range of subscription services not contemplated in Document V1.
   - Family Sharing and new multi-user frameworks change the legal relationships among family groups, especially regarding billing.

2. **Developers / Third-Party Content Providers**:  
   - Document V2 spells out more extensive rules on licensing for third-party apps and content, clarifying Apple’s position as either agent or merchant of record.

3. **Apple and Its Affiliates**:  
   - Apple’s responsibilities have broadened, especially around disclaimers and the removal of content.  
   - New obligations to handle multi-service subscriptions, multi-jurisdiction compliance, and multi-entity contracting.

### Legal Implications

- **Contract Formation and Applicable Law**:  
  - Document V2’s multi-entity structure can change dispute resolution outcomes depending on the consumer’s region. This could impose different consumer protection standards based on local laws.
- **Subscription Continuity and Autopay Risks**:  
  - The new subscription architecture (Document V2) heightens the need for compliance with consumer protection laws regarding auto-renewal notices, price changes, and cancellation. Noncompliance can result in regulatory scrutiny.
- **Data Protection / Privacy**:  
  - Although privacy is referenced in both, Document V2 more explicitly links to Apple’s modern Privacy Policy and addresses updated services (e.g., Apple Fitness+ collects health data). Privacy and data protection obligations intensify with these additional services.
- **Risk of Content Removal**:  
  - Both documents allow Apple to remove content at any time, but Document V2 contains more explicit disclaimers about potential unavailability (e.g., if licensor withdraws rights), raising consumer protection issues (i.e., intangible property rights).
- **Family Sharing Liabilities**:  
  - Document V2 clarifies the “Organizer’s” liability for all purchases by Family group members, illustrating elevated risk if minors or other family members engage in unauthorized or excessive purchases.

### Other Observations

- **Broader Range of Services**: Document V2 captures Apple’s integrated ecosystem, reflecting the shift away from a standalone “iTunes” brand toward multiple streaming, subscription, and cloud-based offerings.  
- **Commercial vs. Noncommercial Use**: There is tighter language in Document V2 restricting the use of content to “personal, noncommercial” unless specifically authorized (e.g., enterprise apps). This may affect small businesses or educational institutions seeking clarity.  
- **Updates and Modifications**: Document V2 explicitly provides Apple with broader rights to modify terms, suspend features, or discontinue services.
