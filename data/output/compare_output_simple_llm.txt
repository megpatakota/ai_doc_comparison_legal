# Summary of Changes

The two documents (collectively, “Document V1” and “Document V2”) outline Apple’s terms and conditions for end‐users purchasing or accessing digital goods and services. Document V1 primarily focuses on the iTunes Store, Mac App Store, App Store, and iBooks Store (updated last in 2015), whereas Document V2 – the “Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions” (updated in 2022) – significantly expands the scope to cover multiple digital services under the “Apple ecosystem,” including Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Fitness+, Apple Arcade, Apple Books, iCloud, and more.

Broadly:

1. **Scope and Services**  
   - Document V2 incorporates new services (e.g., Apple Music, Apple One, Apple Fitness+, Apple TV+), while Document V1 is narrower in covering iTunes Store, Mac App Store, App Store, and iBooks Store.  
   - Document V2 also provides for a consolidated agreement across a wider range of Apple offerings.

2. **Payment, Refunds, and Cancellation**  
   - Both documents cover payment policies, but Document V2’s payment sections are expanded to include subscription renewals, in-app subscriptions, Apple Wallet payment methods, family sharing payment flows, and third-party carrier billing.  
   - Document V2 refines the 14-day cancellation right for EU/UK residents, references direct digital supply disclaimers, and explains how subscriptions auto-renew and how to cancel them.

3. **Governing Law and Parties**  
   - Document V1 references iTunes S.à r.l. (Luxembourg) and sets forth English law for UK-based transactions.  
   - Document V2 reaffirms that Apple Inc., Apple Distribution International, or other Apple affiliates might be the contracting entity, depending on the user’s country. It also expands discussion on how EU residents are bound by the law of their usual place of residence, etc.

4. **Family Sharing, Subscriptions, and Content Usage**  
   - Document V2 sets out a comprehensive policy on Family Sharing, detailing the organizer’s responsibilities, purchase authorization workflows (“Ask to Buy”), and membership changes. Document V1 references iTunes Match/Family Sharing more narrowly.  
   - Document V2 clarifies usage limitations across devices (e.g., how many devices can simultaneously stream Apple TV+ or Apple Music).

5. **Rights, Licenses, and Obligations**  
   - Document V1 emphasizes usage rules and limitations more narrowly (download, number of authorized devices, DRM).  
   - Document V2 adds broader disclaimers and usage rules for Apple’s extended product suite, clarifies Apple’s right to remove or discontinue content, and addresses the (more modern) concept of in-app purchases, third-party content, and Apple device usage.

6. **Privacy and Submissions**  
   - Document V1 references Apple’s Privacy Policy in limited contexts (Genius, iTunes Match data).  
   - Document V2 adds a robust “Your Submissions” section (comments, reviews) with specific guidelines on prohibited content and clarifies Apple’s enforcement rights.

7. **Legal Implications and Risk**  
   - Document V2 presents a more comprehensive limitation of liability and disclaimers, especially with respect to new services and subscription-based content.  
   - The updated terms also affect data handling, jurisdictional issues, and consumer rights in multiple regions (EU, US, etc.).

**Affected Parties**  
- Existing iTunes customers adopting modern Apple services.  
- New customers subscribing to Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Fitness+, or purchasing apps and content.  
- Minors under Family Sharing, especially regarding “Ask to Buy.”  
- Businesses or educational institutions that license certain apps for multiple users.  
- Third-party developers whose apps are distributed via Apple’s App Store environment.

**Legal Implications**  
- Document V2 imposes expanded subscription renewal terms and usage constraints, potentially increasing compliance requirements for Apple and third parties.  
- Updated contract formation, disclaimers, and jurisdiction clauses may alter how disputes are resolved (especially given the references to EU consumer protection laws and local laws for other regions).  
- Parties must carefully adhere to new submission guidelines (ratings, reviews) to avoid liability or account termination.

**Other Pertinent Observations**  
- Document V1 primarily frames the user relationship as between “iTunes S.à r.l.” (in Europe) and the customer, whereas Document V2 merges Apple’s multiple corporate entities and clarifies that the user’s Home Country determines which Apple entity provides the service.  
- Document V2 integrates references to Apple’s cohesive ecosystem, forging a more holistic approach to user content, subscriptions, and privacy.

Summarily addresses “Paid Subscriptions.”                  | - More robust approach to subscription billing in V2. <br> - Potentially more risk for Apple if subscription cancellation processes are not followed. <br> - Additional compliance issues (e.g. consumer protection around auto-renewal notifications).                                                         |
| **Refunds & Cancellation** <br> (V1: iTunes Store-specific vs. V2: Apple-wide strategy)                                          | - **V1**: Right of cancellation for 14 days (EU compliance) with exceptions for digital content if download has begun. <br> - **V2**: Similar 14-day right but clarifies subscriptions can be canceled, includes subscription trials, entire “Effects of cancellation” coverage, more robust disclaimers for immediate digital supply.              | - Expanded language ensures alignment with EU directives for online digital content supplies. <br> - Enhanced clarity on how to reclaim funds, especially with auto-renewing subscriptions. <br> - Additional consumer rights for subscription-based content.                                                 |

| **Privacy** <br> (V1: iTunes data references vs. V2: Expanded coverage)                                                          | - **V1**: Mentions iTunes Match, minimal remarks on data handling. <br> - **V2**: Repeated references to Apple’s Privacy Policy, iCloud Music Library scanning, ID data, Legacy Contact data, usage analytics for Marketing, and more.                                                                                                             | - Aligns with Apple’s broader privacy commitments; possible implications for data collection consent. <br> - Apple’s disclaimers reflect modern data protection standards (e.g., GDPR).                                                                                                                    |
| **Termination & Suspension** <br> (Similar in spirit, but updated language in V2)                                               | - **V1**: Apple (iTunes) can terminate user accounts for breach; references to liability disclaimers. <br> - **V2**: Emphasizes Apple can remove or discontinue entire Services or user access at any time, references “Force Majeure,” underscores Apple’s right to remove previously purchased content under certain circumstances.              | - Greater clarity about Apple’s broad rights to terminate or withdraw access. <br> - Potential risk to consumers who rely on indefinite cloud access. <br> - Legal risk for Apple if removal of purchased content triggers consumer protection or digital goods claims under local law.                             |
