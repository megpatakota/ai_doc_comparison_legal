## Summary of Changes

Overall, Version 1 of the document (“v1.docx”) is significantly more expansive than Version 2 (“v2.docx”), covering numerous product- and service-specific provisions such as Apple’s “1-Click” purchasing mechanism, safety information, licensing terms, third-party equipment usage, and various disclaimers. In contrast, v2.docx presents a leaner framework, omitting or consolidating entire sections and details found in v1.docx. The principal high-level differences include:

1. Extensive “Terms of Sale,” “Service Security,” “Content Security,” and “Intellectual Property” provisions that are present in v1 but not carried over into v2.  
2. Detailed references to specific Apple products and functionalities (e.g., “1-Click®,” “Gift Certificates,” “Pre-Orders,” “iTunes Match,” “iBooks Store,” “Popular Near Me”) that do not appear in v2.  
3. Additional disclaimers and user advisories (e.g., “IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION” and “OBJECTIONABLE MATERIAL”) missing from v2, which may have implications on user notice and liability allocation.  
4. More granular usage and licensing rules for App Store, iBooks Store, and Mac App Store products—distinctly absent in v2—which could alter how end users’ rights are defined and limited in the new version.  

### Affected Parties
- End users (both consumers and commercial/educational entities) who previously relied on the specific disclaimers, usage rules, or safety warnings.  
- Apple, as the “Licensor” or provider of services, which may enjoy different liability protections or disclaimers in v2 if these sections are omitted or less comprehensive.  
- Third-party publishers and developers, whose content-specific disclaimers and usage permissions may be less explicit due to the omissions in v2.  

### Legal Implications
- Reduced Clarity on Rights and Restrictions: Removing explicit licensing and usage rules could lead to interpretational ambiguity and potential disputes over the scope of user rights.  
- Potential Increase in Liability Exposure: Without explicit disclaimers (e.g., safety disclosures, disclaimers of warranties, or “1-Click” disclaimers), Apple or third-party developers may face increased litigation risk.  
- Enforcement Challenges: Omissions of “Service Security” or “Content Security” sections may limit Apple’s ability to enforce or signal certain rights, such as anti-circumvention measures or store policies.  
- Potential Impact on Consumer Protection Compliance: Certain disclaimers (like “Pre-Orders” and “Right of Cancellation”) reflect statutory consumer rights. Omissions heighten risk of noncompliance if local laws require specific disclosures.  

Overall, the differences may substantially alter the balance of rights and obligations between Apple, third-party providers, and end users. Due diligence is recommended to ensure that any omitted provisions in v2 comply with applicable consumer protection, e-commerce, copyright, and privacy statutes.

## Tabulated Differences

Below is a non-exhaustive table capturing the main distinctive sections found in v1.docx but not carried over into v2.docx. Each row details the section at issue, the nature of its omission or modification, and the potential legal implications.

| Section in v1                           | Nature of Differences Compared to v2                      | Legal Implications                                              |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| A ITUNES STORE, MAC APP STORE, APP STORE, AND IBOOKS STORE TERMS OF SALE | • Entire introduction and high-level T&Cs for Apple’s content stores appear omitted in v2. | • Lack of general disclaimers and trouble disclaimers for store usage. <br/> • Could reduce clarity on overarching terms, potentially exposing Apple to broader consumer protection claims. |
| B ITUNES STORE TERMS AND CONDITIONS     | • Additional “B” heading repeating or expanding store T&Cs not retained in v2. | • Potential confusion on which “terms and conditions” govern usage if these are not referenced in v2. <br/> • Could impact enforcement of more routine disclaimers or conditions. |
| 1-Click®                                | • Specific references and disclaimers about “1-Click” purchase mechanism fully omitted. | • Removal of Amazon-licensed “1-Click®” disclaimers can create ambiguity regarding immediate purchase processes and consumer rights to cancel or confirm. <br/> • Heightened risk of consumer disputes if immediate purchase disclaimers are absent. |
| GIFT CERTIFICATES, ITUNES CARDS AND CODES, ALLOWANCES, AND CONTENT CODES | • Terms governing redemption, refunds, and transferring gift certificates removed or drastically abbreviated in v2. | • Potential consumer confusion on gift card usage limitations and disclaimers, exposing Apple to liability regarding their usage and redemption policies. <br/> • May contravene local gift card statutory rules. |
| GIFTS                                   | • Detailed provisions about purchasing and redeeming iTunes gifts not in v2. | • Omitting disclaimers about gift usage across different regions hamper the clarity on cross-border or local gift usage. <br/> • Raises risk of consumer complaints on gift redemption issues. |
| IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION            | • Safety disclaimers (e.g., on seizures, eye strain) also not included. | • Risk of potential claims (e.g., health or user safety issues) due to lack of disclaimers or warnings. <br/> • Less consumer awareness could lead to negligence claims if health hazards occur. |
| PRE-ORDERS                              | • Terms regarding automatic charging of accounts and cancellation rights for pre-orders omitted. | • Increases risk of consumer disputes regarding cancellations and refunds. <br/> • Potential compliance issues in jurisdictions that require pre-order disclaimers or statutory cooling-off periods. |
| ELECTRONIC CONTRACTING                  | • Provisions clarifying electronic signatures as binding are omitted. | • Uncertainty over the enforceability of clickwrap or e-signature. <br/> • May create confusion if local e-commerce regulations require explicit language confirming user’s consent. |
| THE ITUNES STORE SERVICE                | • Specific definition and scope of the iTunes Store Service not in v2. | • Possible reduced clarity on the scope of services. <br/> • Potential difficulty distinguishing the iTunes Service from other Apple services for liability or licensing. |
| REQUIREMENTS FOR USE OF THE SERVICE (iTunes) | • Requirements (like age limits, geographical usage) are absent or summarized. | • Could expose Apple to COPPA or jurisdiction-based claims if minors or out-of-territory users are not explicitly restricted/disclosed. |
| USE OF CONTENT                          | • Detailed usage constraints around downloaded content missing in v2. | • Reduced clarity on permissible use and potential intellectual property infringement. |
| CONTENT SECURITY                        | • Security framework disclaimers (e.g., DRM restrictions) not present. | • Potentially undermines Apple’s ability to enforce user compliance with DRM or anti-piracy security. |
| SERVICE SECURITY                        | • Prohibitions on unauthorized access or software modification absent. | • Could hamper Apple’s ramifications against users circumventing security or hacking. |
| HIGH-DEFINITION (HD) PRODUCTS           | • Terms on HD content usage and limitations not in v2.     | • Potential user confusion over device compatibility or HD usage rights. |
| OBJECTIONABLE MATERIAL                  | • No disclaimers on potentially offensive content.         | • Higher complaint or liability risk if users encounter offensive content without prior notice. |
| INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY                   | • Broad statements about Apple’s or third parties’ IP rights not found. | • Erodes clarity around Apple’s or developer IP ownership. <br/> • Potentially riskier environment for IP disputes. |
| THE MAC APP STORE, APP STORE AND IBOOKS STORE | • Another overarching introduction and T&Cs for Mac App Store, App Store, and iBooks Store removed. | • Consolidation or omission might cause confusion over whether these store-specific rules remain in effect or are replaced. |
| REQUIREMENTS FOR USE OF THE STORES (Mac and iOS) | • Mirror of the identical references in iTunes Service “Requirements” also removed. | • Potentially eliminates region restrictions, age limitations, or compliance disclaimers. |
| AUTOMATIC DELIVERY OF UPDATES           | • Explanation about automatic app updates absent.           | • Users may not be aware that updates occur automatically, which can lead to consumer law concerns about forced updates. |
| APP BUNDLES                             | • Terms about bundled apps pricing and partial purchase credit absent. | • Could lead to disputes on partial refunds or credit for previously purchased app components. |
| IN-APP PURCHASES                        | • Terms about consumables, authentication windows, and disclaimers are missing. | • Raises risk of unauthorized purchase claims, especially for child accounts. <br/> • Incomplete disclaimers may cause noncompliance with local regulations on “free-to-play” style apps. |
| POPULAR NEAR ME                         | • Omission of location-based or usage metric disclaimers.   | • Privacy concerns if location-based features are not fully disclosed. |
| LICENSED APPLICATION END USER LICENCE AGREEMENT | • Detailed “Standard EULA” for Apple or third-party apps not included in v2. | • Contractual gaps for how Apple or third-party developers convey usage rights, disclaimers, and restrictions to users. |
| FURTHER IBOOKS STORE TERMS AND CONDITIONS; LICENSE OF IBOOKS STORE PRODUCTS; IBOOKS STORE PRODUCT USAGE RULES | • Rules that clarify iBooks licensing, usage on different devices, and restrictions are omitted. | • May lead to confusion about user rights on e-books (e.g., if an iBooks purchase is restricted to iOS devices only). <br/> • Potential risk for consumer confusion regarding transferrable or shareable rights. |

**Note**: The above table focuses on major omissions; further minor wording changes or re-ordering are likewise notable. Disclaimers and usage limitations are critical in terms of intellectual property, consumer protection, and overall compliance strategy. The net effect of these deletions, if not otherwise relocated within v2, is an increased risk profile for Apple and content providers, particularly around capacity to defend or disclaim liability under certain use scenarios.

Please review these findings in light of applicable local and international e-commerce, consumer protection, and digital content regulations. Additional due diligence is advised on whether Apple or third-party disclaimers are still sufficiently covered elsewhere in v2, and whether the omissions might create unintentional compliance gaps or litigation risks.
