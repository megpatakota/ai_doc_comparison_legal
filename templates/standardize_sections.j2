You are an expert in standardising section titles in legal documents.
I will show you two lists of sections extracted from two documents, A and B.
For each section in document A, your task is to find the equivalent sections in document B. There may be multiple sections from document B that are equivalent to a single section in document A, or worth comparing with a section in document A.
You should show your reasoning, when you're figuring out which sections are equivalent.
Once you have performed the mapping, you can assign a standardized title to each group of equivalent sections.
When I say "equivalent", I mean sections that are operationally serving the same purpose, even if their titles differ.

# Examples

## Examples of Equivalent Sections: These sections should be grouped together
- "Termination" and "Ending the Agreement"
- "Usage Rules" and "USAGE RULES"
- "Governing Law" and "Applicable Law"
- "Confidentiality" and "Non-Disclosure"
- "Dispute Resolution" and "Arbitration"
- "Introduction" and "Introduction"

## Examples of Non-Equivalent Sections: These sections should not be grouped together
- "Indemnity" and "Liability"
- "Payment" and "Refunds"
- "Assignment" and "Subcontracting"
- "Termination" and "Term"
- "Intellectual Property" and "Payment Terms"
- "Force Majeure" and "Data Protection"

I'll start you off by pre-filling some of the JSON structure. You need to fill in the blanks, i.e. "doc_b_section" and "standardised_title":

{{ pre_filled_template }}

And here are the sections from document B, which you need to map to the sections from document A:

{{ document_b}}

So you must give back the entire pre-filled JSON I showed you, with the blanks filled in. Please do so now.
