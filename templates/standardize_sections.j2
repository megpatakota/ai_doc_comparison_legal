Compare the sections from the two JSON files and create standardized titles for similar sections.

For each group of similar sections across documents, create a standardized entry with:
1. A "standardized_title" that best represents all similar sections
2. A "mappings" array containing all the original sections that map to this standardized title

Follow this format:
[
  {
    "standardized_title": "Introduction",
    "mappings": [
      {"title": "TERMS AND CONDITIONS", "line_id": "0", "doc_id": "1"},
      {"title": "INTRODUCTION TO OUR SERVICES", "line_id": "2", "doc_id": "2"}
    ]
  },
  {
    "standardized_title": "Payment and Refunds",
    "mappings": [
      {"title": "PAYMENTS, TAXES, AND REFUND POLICY", "line_id": "8", "doc_id": "1"},
      {"title": "PAYMENTS, TAXES AND REFUNDS", "line_id": "5", "doc_id": "2"}
    ]
  }
]

Guidelines for standardization:
- Group sections with similar content/purpose even if titles differ
- Choose clear, concise standardized titles
- Include ALL sections from both documents
- If a section appears in only one document, it still gets a standardized title with just one mapping
- Preserve the exact original title, line_id, and doc_id in the mappings

Return only a valid JSON array with the standardized sections.

Document 1 sections:
{{ doc1_sections }}

Document 2 sections:
{{ doc2_sections }}
