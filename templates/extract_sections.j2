Analyze the following text from Terms and Conditions. For each section you find:
1. Identify the section title, these should be obvious titles and not appear as possible sub-sections. ONLY use titles that explicitly appear in the text - do not create, infer, or generate titles based on external knowledge.
2. Read the text content that follows the section title until the next section title.
3. Write a generic description of that section that could be used to disambiguate it.
4. Extract the line_id from the {{text}} based of the extracted section title (the number X from id="X" in the opening tag).

For example, if you find a section title in a line like:
<line id="42">TERMINATION</line_id>
<line id="43">Some text from the TERMINATION section</line>
...
<line id="49">Some more text from the TERMINATION section</line>
<line id="50">Next section title</line>

The corresponding entry in your JSON output should be:
{
  "title": "TERMINATION",
  "description": "Outlines the conditions under which an agreement may be ended by either party, including notice requirements, breach of contract, or other specified events",
  "start_id": "42",
  "end_id": "49"
}

Your complete response should be a JSON array containing all identified sections:
[
  {"title": "Terms of Use", "description": "Defines the rules and guidelines governing the use of a service, including user rights, responsibilities, and limitations.", "start_id": "12", "end_id": "23"},
  {"title": "PRIVACY POLICY", "description": "Explains how personal data is collected, used, stored, and shared, as well as the rights of users regarding their information.", "start_id": "42", "end_id": "55"},
  {"title": "REFUND POLICY", "description": "Specifies the conditions under which customers may request refunds, including eligibility criteria, timeframes, and any applicable fees.", "start_id": "78", "end_id": "89"}
]

IMPORTANT: 
- Do not include any text before or after the JSON array, even the line_id or doc_id should not be part of the title extracted from the document.
- ONLY include sections with titles that explicitly appear in the text.
- DO NOT create or infer section titles that don't exist in the original text.

Text to analyze:
{{ text }}
