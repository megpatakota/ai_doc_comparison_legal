Analyze the following text from Terms and Conditions. Note: Each line in the text is wrapped with a custom tag in the format: 
<line id="X">...<line_id>. For each section you find, do the following:
1. Extract the section title.
2. Record its corresponding line id from the custom tag that wraps the section title.
3. Create a brief one-sentence description of the section's main purpose.

Return the results as a JSON list of dictionaries, where each dictionary has exactly three keys: "title", "Purpose", and "line_id". For example:
[
  {"title": "Section Title 1", "Purpose": "Description for section 1.", "line_id": "0"},
  {"title": "Section Title 2", "Purpose": "Description for section 2.", "line_id": "5"}
]

Respond with only the JSON array.
